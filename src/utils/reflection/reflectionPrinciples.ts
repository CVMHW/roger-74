  description: "A way of showing the client that the counselor understands what the client is communicating by restating the emotional part of the message",
  examples: ["It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with this situation", "I hear that you're worried about what might happen next"],
  purpose: "To check the accuracy of the helper's understanding of the client's experience, not to mechanically reflect words",
  approach: "Each response contains the unspoken question: 'Is this the way it is in you? Am I catching the personal meaning you are experiencing right now?'",
  goal: "To perceive the client's inner world as accurately as possible, bringing the helper's perception in line with the client's experience"
