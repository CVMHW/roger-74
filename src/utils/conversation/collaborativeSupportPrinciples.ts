    description: "The collaborative relationship in peer support is guided by principles from Carl Rogers' person-centered approach and collaborative psychotherapy, as described by Peggy Natiello and others.",
    values: [
      "Human nature is basically trustworthy and positive - individuals can be trusted to make decisions and solve problems given an appropriately supportive climate",
      "Collaborative relationships are more growth-promoting than authoritarian or power-over relationships",
      "In a collaborative relationship, both persons may be positively changed by the interaction",
      "Psychological health includes the capacity for healthy interdependence and connectedness",
      "In collaborative support, the person seeking help influences the process as much as the helper does"
    ]
  },
  characteristics: [
    "Commitment to being real, transparent, and fully present as a person rather than acting as the expert",
    "Openness, responsiveness, and dignity in interactions",
    "Personal empowerment and alternating influence",
    "Cooperation rather than control",
    "Being responsible to each other rather than for each other",
    "Fostering trust in the person's capacity for self-direction"
  ],
  approach: [
    "Creating a safe space for exploration without judgment",
    "Listening deeply to understand rather than to diagnose or fix",
    "Respecting the person's wisdom about their own life",
    "Sharing personal experience when appropriate to demonstrate shared humanity",
    "Recognizing that healing happens through authentic connection",
    "Trusting in the person's natural movement toward growth"
  ],
  quotes: [
    "A collaborative relationship is defined as a relationship in which the capacity to act or effect change is shared by all persons in the relationship rather than being assigned to one person who is seen as the authority or expert.",
    "Rogers clearly appreciated the value of the relationship and the potential for growth in both persons that comes from the connectedness present in the relationship.",
    "Collaborative relationships are characterized by openness, responsiveness, dignity, personal empowerment, alternating influence, and cooperation.",
    "Healing responses cannot be taught, but they become clear as the collaborative relationship matures and as helpers enhance their self-awareness and their understanding of collaboration.",
    "It is important to convey that we are in this journey together, and the person will ultimately be the one who has the answers for themselves."
